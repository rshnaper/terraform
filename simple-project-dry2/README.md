This project demonstrates the ability to use terraform in DRY fashion by externalizing only the backend configuration and inputs. In this version the data directory is initialized using `TF_DATA_DIR` variable in the helper script. This way each environment has it's own specific configuration and no re-initilization of terraform backend is needed when switching environments.
